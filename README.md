# JAVASCRIPT CAPSTONE Project - API based webapp


> The Javascript capstone project is about building a web application based on an external API.
  The data of the webapp will be provided by the chosen API. 
  The webapp will have a home page showing a list of items that can be "liked".
  The webapp will contain a popup window with more data about an item which can be "commented".
  The counters are made to count the numbers of "like" and "comments".
  The tests are also incorporated for the counters.
